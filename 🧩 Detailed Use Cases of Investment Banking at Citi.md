Here’s a **detailed layman + technical breakdown** for the 5 investment banking use cases you selected, along with **JPA entity design and relationships**:

---

## 🔹 1. **IPO (Initial Public Offering) Management**

### 🧑‍🏫 Layman Explanation:

Citi helps private companies become public by listing them on the stock market. This involves planning the IPO, estimating company valuation, assigning underwriters (like Citi), and filing with regulators.

### 🛠️ Technical Features:

* Create, view, and update IPO requests.
* IPOs go through various statuses: `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `FILED`, `CLOSED`.

### 🗃️ JPA Entity:

```java
@Entity
public class IPORequest {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String companyName;

    private BigDecimal expectedValuation;

    private LocalDate plannedDate;

    private String underwriterBank;

    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private IPOStatus status;

    private LocalDate createdDate;
    private LocalDate updatedDate;
}

public enum IPOStatus {
    PENDING, APPROVED, FILED, CLOSED
}
```

---

## 🔹 2. **Mergers & Acquisitions (M\&A) Deal Tracking**

### 🧑‍🏫 Layman Explanation:

When two companies merge or one acquires another, Citi acts as a middleman — analyzing finances, risks, and benefits of the deal.

### 🛠️ Technical Features:

* Track M\&A deals across statuses: `INITIATED`, `DUE_DILIGENCE`, `COMPLETED`, `ABORTED`.
* Link multiple analysts/advisors to a single deal.

### 🗃️ JPA Entity:

```java
@Entity
public class MergerDeal {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long dealId;

    private String acquirerCompany;
    private String targetCompany;

    private BigDecimal proposedValue;

    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private DealStatus status;

    private LocalDate initiationDate;

    @ManyToMany
    private List<Advisor> assignedAdvisors;
}

public enum DealStatus {
    INITIATED, DUE_DILIGENCE, COMPLETED, ABORTED
}

@Entity
public class Advisor {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String name;
    private String email;
}
```

---

## 🔹 3. **Debt & Equity Underwriting**

### 🧑‍🏫 Layman Explanation:

Citi guarantees to raise a specific amount of capital by selling stocks (equity) or bonds (debt) for a company. Citi may buy the securities and sell them to the public.

### 🛠️ Technical Features:

* Submit underwriting requests.
* Differentiate between equity and debt offerings.

### 🗃️ JPA Entity:

```java
@Entity
public class UnderwritingRequest {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String issuerCompany;

    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private SecurityType type;

    private BigDecimal amount;

    private LocalDate issueDate;

    private String leadManager;

}

public enum SecurityType {
    EQUITY, DEBT
}
```

## 🔹 4. **Client Portfolio Advisory & Monitoring**

### 🧑‍🏫 Layman Explanation:

Citi gives financial advice to institutional clients on what to buy/sell, how to diversify investments, and how to manage risk.

### 🛠️ Technical Features:

* Assign investment advisors to clients.
* Record portfolio advice.
* Store rebalancing recommendations.

### 🗃️ JPA Entity:

```java
@Entity
public class Client {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

Citi publishes financial reports that analyze market conditions, trends, risks, and opportunities — shared with its investment banking clients.

### 🛠️ Technical Features:

* Publish new reports.
* Search latest reports.
* Categorize reports (e.g., sector-wise: Tech, Pharma).

### 🗃️ JPA Entity:

```java
@Entity
public class MarketReport {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long reportId;

    private String title;
    private String author;

    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private ReportCategory category;

    private String content;

    private LocalDateTime publishedAt;
}

public enum ReportCategory {
    TECH, PHARMA, ENERGY, BANKING, GENERAL
}
```

---

### 🧵 Suggested Relationships Overview:

* One `Client` → Many `InvestmentAdvice`
* Many `Advisors` ↔ Many `MergerDeals`
* Enum types for statuses & categories for easy filtering
* Use `@ElementCollection` for simple value lists (e.g., recommendations)

## 🔹 6. **Syndicated Loan Management**

### 🧑‍🏫 Layman Explanation:

### 🛠️ Technical Features:

* Create syndicated loan deals
* Track participating banks and their shares
* Manage repayment schedule

### 🗃️ JPA Entity:

```java
@Entity
public class SyndicatedLoan {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String borrower;
    private BigDecimal totalAmount;
    private LocalDate loanStartDate;
    private LocalDate maturityDate;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "loan", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    private List<LoanParticipation> participants;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "loan", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    private List<RepaymentSchedule> repayments;
}

@Entity
public class LoanParticipation {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    @ManyToOne
    private SyndicatedLoan loan;

    private String bankName;
    private BigDecimal contributionAmount;
}

@Entity
public class RepaymentSchedule {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    @ManyToOne
    private SyndicatedLoan loan;

    private LocalDate dueDate;
    private BigDecimal amount;
    private boolean isPaid;
}
```

## 🔹 7. **Risk Assessment & Compliance Tracking**

### 🧑‍🏫 Layman Explanation:

Before investing or underwriting, Citi must assess financial, legal, geopolitical, and reputational risks. Each investment activity must also comply with regulations.

### 🛠️ Technical Features:

* Submit risk assessments
* Link to IPO/M\&A/Underwriting records
* Assign compliance officers

### 🗃️ JPA Entity:

```java
@Entity
public class RiskAssessment {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String associatedDealType; // IPO, M&A, etc.
    private Long referenceId; // ID from associated entity

    private String riskCategory; // CREDIT, MARKET, LEGAL
    private String findings;
    private String mitigationPlan;

    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private RiskSeverity severity; // LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH

    private String complianceOfficer;
    private LocalDate assessmentDate;
}

public enum RiskSeverity {
    LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH
}
```

> ✅ Use `referenceId` and `associatedDealType` to loosely link RiskAssessment to other entities using a dynamic join pattern (or a polymorphic design).

## 🔹 8. **Client Pitch Book & Proposal Tracking**

### 🧑‍🏫 Layman Explanation:

Before making a deal, Citi prepares a **pitch book** (detailed presentation) for the client — showcasing financial analysis, deal structure, and valuation to win the client’s confidence.

### 🛠️ Technical Features:

* Store pitch book metadata (client, deal type, date)
* Upload PDF/URL for document
* Track outcome (WON, LOST, UNDER\_REVIEW)

### 🗃️ JPA Entity:

```java
@Entity
public class PitchBook {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String clientName;
    private String dealType; // M&A, IPO, Loan

    private String documentUrl; // Cloud location
    private LocalDate presentationDate;

    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private PitchStatus status;

    private String remarks;
}

public enum PitchStatus {
    WON, LOST, UNDER_REVIEW
}
```
