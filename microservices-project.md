### üß™ Suggested Feature Development Steps:

1. **Start with `patient-service`**:

   * REST API with DTO, Validation, Exception Handling.
2. **Add `appointment-service`** with Feign client call to `patient-service`.
3. **Set up `config-server`, `eureka-server`, and `api-gateway`.**
4. **Add frontend React app**, integrated via API Gateway.
5. **Implement Resilience4j** in `appointment-service` for patient-service communication.
6. **Add tracing with Sleuth + Zipkin.**
7. **Dockerize each microservice**, then use `docker-compose` for full setup.
8. **Document all APIs using OpenAPI/Swagger.**
